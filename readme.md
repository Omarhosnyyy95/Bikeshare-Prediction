## Brief
Building a multi-layer perceptron neural network from scratch **using only Numpy** to predict daily bike rental ridership. This project is the first project in the Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program and its main goal is to understand how neural networks work before diving into deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and other types of neural networks like CNN, RNN, etc.

## Conclusion
acceptable predictions, but the model prediction is overestimating the bike ridership in December. This is probably because there is no sufficient holiday season training data.
